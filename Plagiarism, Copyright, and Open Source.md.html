<p>“I feel like this could be because you do not want someone to steal your work before you are able to publish it, taking a short cut by stealing the work you have already done. Yes, in an ideal world where no one takes other peoples information for their own, making the information readily available from the beginning of the project would be great, but there are a lot of things that need to be thought about before doing that I believe.” – <a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html#annotations:lSCiyFiIEeijnbMIODYc7w">MarkyMarc</a></p>

<p>I think that there are definitely pros and cons to open source history. On the one hand, there are worries about plagiarism, competition in one’s field, and lack of <a href="https://hyp.is/7-kyJloMEeiolLtFBN059Q/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html">innovation</a>. In his annotation quoted above, MarkyMarc voices these concerns, which I was also worried about when I began reading McDaniel’s article. It’s easy to think that someone could undermine your work when you utilize open sources from the beginning of a project. However, there are also benefits to it such as having access to different sources, being able to collaborate ideas, having constructive criticism, saving time on failed tests, and so on.</p>
<p>I’m excited about the potential of open sources, so MarkyMarc’s annotation made me think about what needs to be done in order to prevent potential plagiarism that could occur from open sourced history. I wonder if it’s possible to copyright a theory and attach it to a list of sources as a safeguard against plagiarism until the work has been completed, in which the final product would be copyrighted. This would still allow the sources to be used, but not in the same line of thought. Potentially, there could be room for some overlap. Even if people could use one or two of the same sources with a similar theory, it could lead to similar studies that have differing specific focuses. I’d like to find out if this would be possible, or if it has been developed.</p>
